# React

- React is a JavaScript Library for Building User Interfaces
- It allows Developers to create reusable UI Components and manage the State of those Components in a simple and
  efficient Way
- It is based on a Component-based Architecture. Each component can have its own State, which determines how it should
  be rendered at any given Time
- It also uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model), which is a lightweight Copy of the real DOM. This allows React to
  efficiently make UI Updates without having to redraw the entire Page

## Dependencies

- In a `npm` Project, Dependencies and DevDependencies refer to two different Types of Packages that a Project may
  require
    - Dependencies are Packages that the Project needs to run. They are Packages that are needed at Runtime and are
      therefore essential for the Project to work properly
    - DevDependencies are Packages that are only needed during Development. They are Packages that are used for Testing,
      Linting or Building the Project, but are not needed at Runtime
- Listing Packages as DevDependencies rather than Dependencies can help keep the Project's Dependencies lean and focused
  on what is actually needed to run the Application
- This can reduce the overall size of the Dependencies installed when the Application is deployed, as well as reducing
  the Potential for Security Vulnerabilities
